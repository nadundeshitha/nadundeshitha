# [Your Name]
### Passionate in Biomedical Engineering | Signal Processing | Embedded Systems

I'm [Your Name], a 2nd-year Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering undergraduate at the University of Moratuwa. I specialize in electronics and biomedical applications, with a strong interest in how signal processing and control systems can solve healthcare challenges.

I am actively involved in the **IEEE EMBS student chapter**, where I serve as the lead for web PR and design. One of my key contributions was designing the visual identity for the **"Brainstorm"** event. I enjoy meticulous project planning, from creating technical proposals to developing hardware prototypes like the **Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) sensor** I built using a 555 timer and ESP32.

In my academic journey, I’ve worked on diverse engineering problems, including a deep-dive dissection of **Gigabyte motherboard architectures** and designing **multi-range analog voltmeters**. Recently, I participated in the **SPARK Challenge**, developing an "Automatic Drain Cleaning & Water Quality Protection System" to address environmental issues through automation.

Outside of core engineering, I have a keen eye for aesthetics, frequently working on graphic design for event flyers and project enclosures. I'm also proficient in C++, Python, and LaTeX.
